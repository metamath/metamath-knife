This is part of an ongoing project to improve naming consistency.  If you have
suggestions for better names, let me know.

To update your mathbox, you can make global substitutions into
your local version by processing the ones WITHOUT "Notes" in REVERSE order.
The ones WITH "Notes" may have to be processed manually.

PROPOSED:
Date      Old       New         Notes
proposed  syl       imtri       (analogous to *bitr*, sstri, etc.)
proposed  sylib     imbitri     etc.
proposed  sylbid    biimtrd     etc.
proposed  sylbird   biimtrrd    etc.
proposed  syl5*     *trid       (syl5bi -> biimtrid; syl5eqel -> eqeltrid;etc.)
proposed  syl6*     *trdi
proposed  *mpt*     *mpf* or *mptf* (maps-to for functions)
proposed  *mpt2*    *mpo* or *mpto* (maps-to for operations)
(Please send any comments on these proposals to Norm Megill.)

                      4. Metamath syntax summary
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

The HELP LANGUAGE command in the Metamath program will give you a quick
overview of Metamath.  The official spec is found on pp. 92-95 of the
Metamath book.  The following syntax summary is provided for convenience
but may omit some details.

A Metamath database (set of one or more ASCII source files) is a sequence of
_tokens_, which are normally separated by spaces or line breaks.  The only
tokens that are built into the Metamath language are those (two-character
sequences) beginning with $, shown in the following. These tokens are called
_keywords_:

          $c ... $. - Constant declaration
          $v ... $. - Variable declaration
          $d ... $. - Disjoint (distinct) variable restriction
  <label> $f ... $. - "Floating" hypothesis (i.e. variable type declaration)
  <label> $e ... $. - "Essential" hypothesis (i.e. a logical assumption for a
                      theorem or axiom)
  <label> $a ... $. - Axiom or definition or syntax construction
  <label> $p ... $= ... $. - Theorem and its proof
          ${ ... $} - Block for defining the scope of the above statements
                      (except $a, $p which are forever active)
$)        $( ... $)
$(                  - Comments (may not be nested); see HELP LANGUAGE
                      for markup features.
          $[ ... $] - Include a file

The only "logic" Metamath uses in its proof verification algorithm is the
substitution of expressions for variables while checking for distinct variable
violations.  Everything else, including the axioms for logic, is defined in the
database.

All other tokens are user-defined, and their names are arbitrary.  There are
two kinds of user-defined tokens, called math symbols (or just symbols) and
labels.  A _symbol_ may contain any non-whitespace printable character except
"$".  A _label_ may contain only alphanumeric characters and the characters "."
(period), "-" (hyphen), and "_" (underscore).  Symbols and labels are
case-sensitive.  All labels (except in proofs) must be distinct.  A label may
not have the same name as a symbol (to simplify the coding of certain parsers
and translators).

Here is some more detail about the syntax.:

  $c <symbollist> $.
      <symbollist> is a (whitespace-separated) list of distinct symbols that
      haven't been used before.
  $v <symbollist> $.
      <symbollist> is a list of distinct symbols that haven't been used yet
      in the current scope (see ${ ... $} below).
  $d <symbollist> $.
      <symbollist> is a (whitespace-separated) list of distinct symbols
      previously declared with $v in current scope.  It means that
      substitutions into these symbols may not have variables in common.
  <label> $f <symbollist> $.
      <symbollist> is a list of 2 symbols, the first of which must be
      previously declared with $c in the current scope.
  <label> $e <symbollist> $.
      <symbollist> is a list of 2 or more symbols, the first of which must be
      previously declared with $c in the current scope.
  <label> $a <symbollist> $.
      <symbollist> is a list of 2 or more symbols, the first of which must be
      previously declared with $c in the current scope.
  <label> $p <symbollist> $= <proof> $.
      <symbollist> is a list of 2 or more symbols, the first of which must be
      previously declared with $c in the current scope.  <proof> is either a
      whitespace-delimited sequence of previous labels (created by
      SAVE PROOF <label> /NORMAL) or a compressed proof (created by
      SAVE PROOF <label> /COMPRESSED).  After using SAVE PROOF, use
      WRITE SOURCE to save the database file to disk.
  ${ ... $}
      Block for scoping the above statements (except $a, $p which are forever
      active).  Currently, $c may not occur inside of a block.
$)
  $( <any text> $)
$(    Comment.  Note: <any text> may not contain adjacent "$" and ")"
      characters.  The comment opening and closing delimiters must be
      surrounded by whitespace (space, tab, CR, LF, or FF).
  $[ <filename> $]
      Insert contents of <filename> at this point.  If <filename> is current
      file or has been already been inserted, it will not be inserted again.

Inside of comments, it is recommended that labels be preceded with a tilde (~)
and math symbol tokens be enclosed in grave accents (` `).  This way the LaTeX
and HTML rendition of comments will be accurate, and (future) tools to globally
change labels and math symbols will also change them in comments.  Note that
inside of grave accents a pair of grave accents is interpreted as a single
grave accent.  A special comment containing $ t defines LaTeX and HTML symbols.
See HELP LANGUAGE and HELP HTML for other markup features in comments.

The proofs in this file are in "compressed" format for storage efficiency.  The
Metamath program reads the compressed format directly.  This format is
described in an Appendix of the Metamath book.  It is not intended to be read
by humans.  For viewing proofs you should use the various SHOW PROOF commands
described in the Metamath book (or the on-line HELP).

The Metamath program does not normally affect any content of this file (set.mm)
other than proofs, i.e. the text between "$=" and "$.".  All other content is
user-created.  Proofs are created or modified with the PROVE command.

                          5. Other notes
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

1. It is recommended that you be familiar with chapters 2 and 4 of the
'Metamath' book to understand the Metamath language.  Chapters 2, 3 and 5
explain how to use the program.  Chapter 3 gives you an informal overview of
what this source file is all about.  Appendix A shows you the standard
mathematical symbols corresponding to some of the ASCII tokens in this file.

The ASCII tokens may seem cryptic at first, even if you are familiar with set
theory, but a review of the definition summary in Chapter 3 should quickly
enable you to see the correspondence to standard mathematical notation.  To
easily find the definition of a token, search for the first occurrences of the
token surrounded by spaces.  Some odd-looking ones include "-." for "not", and
"C_" for "is a subset of."  (HELP TEX tells you how to obtain a LaTeX output to
see the real mathematical symbols.)  Let me know if you have better suggestions
for naming ASCII tokens.

2. Theorems can be written in different forms: "closed form", "deduction form"
or "inference form" (for details see ~ conventions ).  We prefer to write
theorems in "deduction form" - we call this approach "deduction style" - and
try to avoid theorems in "inference form" unless there are reasonable grounds
for it.

3. On providing new definitions and theorems, the conventions provided in the
comment of ~ conventions should be obeyed.

###############################################################################
            CLASSICAL FIRST-ORDER LOGIC WITH EQUALITY
###############################################################################

  Logic can be defined as the "study of the principles of correct reasoning"
  (Merrilee H. Salmon's 1991 "Informal Reasoning and Informal Logic" in
  _Informal Reasoning and Education_) or as "a formal system using symbolic
  techniques and mathematical methods to establish truth-values" (the Oxford
  English Dictionary).

  This section formally defines the logic system we will use.  In particular,
  it defines symbols for declaring truthful statements, along with rules for
  deriving truthful statements from other truthful statements.  The system
  defined here is classical first-order logic with equality (the most common
  logic system used by mathematicians).

  We begin with a few housekeeping items in pre-logic, and then introduce
  propositional calculus (both its axioms and important theorems that can be
  derived from them).  Propositional calculus deals with general truths about
  well-formed formulas (wffs) regardless of how they are constructed.  This is
  followed by proofs that other axiomatizations of classical propositional
  calculus can be derived from the axioms we have chosen to use.

  We then define predicate calculus, which adds additional symbols and rules
  useful for discussing objects (beyond simply true or false).  In particular,
  it introduces the symbols ` = ` ("equals"), ` e. ` ("is a member of"), and `
  A. ` ("for all").  The first two are called "predicates."  A predicate
  specifies a true or false relationship between its two arguments.

    $( (_Note_:  This inference rule and the next one, ~ idi , will normally
       never appear in a completed proof.  They can be ignored if you are using
       this database to assist learning logic - please start with the statement
       ~ wn instead.)

       This is a technical inference to assist proof development.  It provides
       a temporary way to add an independent subproof to a proof under
       development, for later assignment to a normal proof step.

       The metamath program's Proof Assistant requires proofs to be developed
       backwards from the conclusion with no gaps, and it has no mechanism that
       lets the user to work on isolated subproofs.  This inference provides a
       workaround for this limitation.  It can be inserted at any point in a
       proof to allow an independent subproof to be developed on the side, for
       later use as part of the final proof.

       _Instructions_:  (1) Assign this inference to any unknown step in the
       proof.  Typically, the last unknown step is the most convenient, since
       'assign last' can be used.  This step will be replicated in hypothesis
       dummylink.1, from where the development of the main proof can continue.
       (2) Develop the independent subproof backwards from hypothesis
       dummylink.2.  If desired, use a 'let' command to pre-assign the
       conclusion of the independent subproof to dummylink.2.  (3) After the
       independent subproof is complete, use 'improve all' to assign it
       automatically to an unknown step in the main proof that matches it.  (4)
       After the entire proof is complete, use 'minimize *' to clean up
       (discard) all dummylink references automatically.

       This inference was originally designed to assist importing partially
       completed Proof Worksheets from the mmj2 Proof Assistant GUI, but it can
       also be useful on its own.  Interestingly, no axioms are required for
       its proof.  It is the inference associated with ~ a1i .  (Contributed by

#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#

  Propositional calculus deals with general truths about well-formed formulas
  (wffs) regardless of how they are constructed.  The simplest propositional
  truth is ` ( ph -> ph ) ` , which can be read "if something is true, then it
  is true" - rather trivial and obvious, but nonetheless it must be proved from
  the axioms (see theorem ~ id ).

  Our system of propositional calculus consists of three basic axioms and
  another axiom that defines the modus-ponens inference rule.  It is attributed
  to Jan Lukasiewicz (pronounced woo-kah-SHAY-vitch) and was popularized by
  Alonzo Church, who called it system P2.  (Thanks to Ted Ulrich for this
  information.)  These axioms are ~ ax-1 , ~ ax-2 , ~ ax-3 , and (for modus
  ponens) ~ ax-mp . Some closely followed texts include [Margaris] for the
  axioms and [WhiteheadRussell] for the theorems.

  The propositional calculus used here is the classical system widely used by
  mathematicians.  In particular, this logic system accepts the "law of the
  excluded middle" as proven in ~ exmid , which says that a logical statement
  is either true or not true.  This is an essential distinction of classical
  logic and is not a theorem of intuitionistic logic.

  All 194 axioms, definitions, and theorems for propositional calculus in
  _Principia Mathematica_ (specifically *1.2 through *5.75) are axioms or
  formally proven.  See the Bibliographic Cross-References at
  ~ http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/mmbiblio.html for a complete
  cross-reference from sources used to its formalization in the Metamath

  $( If ` ph ` is a wff, so is ` -. ph ` or "not ` ph ` ."  Part of the
     recursive definition of a wff (well-formed formula).  In classical logic
     (which is our logic), a wff is interpreted as either true or false.  So if
     ` ph ` is true, then ` -. ph ` is false; if ` ph ` is false, then
     ` -. ph ` is true.  Traditionally, Greek letters are used to represent
     wffs, and we follow this convention.  In propositional calculus, we define
     only wffs built up from other wffs, i.e. there is no starting or "atomic"
     wff.  Later, in predicate calculus, we will extend the basic wff
     definition by including atomic wffs ( ~ weq and ~ wel ). $)
  wn $a wff -. ph $.

  $( If ` ph ` and ` ps ` are wff's, so is ` ( ph -> ps ) ` or " ` ph ` implies
     ` ps ` ."  Part of the recursive definition of a wff.  The resulting wff
     is (interpreted as) false when ` ph ` is true and ` ps ` is false; it is
     true otherwise.  Think of the truth table for an OR gate with input ` ph `
     connected through an inverter.  After we define the axioms of
     propositional calculus ( ~ ax-1 , ~ ax-2 , ~ ax-3 , and ~ ax-mp ), the
     biconditional ( ~ df-bi ), the constant true ` T. ` ( ~ df-tru ), and the
     constant false ` F. ` ( ~ df-fal ), we will be able to prove these truth
     table values: ` ( ( T. -> T. ) <-> T. ) ` ( ~ truimtru ),
     ` ( ( T. -> F. ) <-> F. ) ` ( ~ truimfal ), ` ( ( F. -> T. ) <-> T. ) `
     ( ~ falimtru ), and ` ( ( F. -> F. ) <-> T. ) ` ( ~ falimfal ).  These
     have straightforward meanings, for example, ` ( ( T. -> T. ) <-> T. ) `
     just means "the value of ` ( T. -> T. ) ` is ` T. ` ".

     The left-hand wff is called the antecedent, and the right-hand wff is
     called the consequent.  In the case of ` ( ph -> ( ps -> ch ) ) ` , the
     middle ` ps ` may be informally called either an antecedent or part of the
     consequent depending on context.  Contrast with ` <-> ` ( ~ df-bi ),
     ` /\ ` ( ~ df-an ), and ` \/ ` ( ~ df-or ).

     This is called "material implication" and the arrow is usually read as
     "implies."  However, material implication is not identical to the meaning
     of "implies" in natural language.  For example, the word "implies" may
     suggest a causal relationship in natural language.  Material implication
     does not require any causal relationship.  Also, note that in material
     implication, if the consequent is true then the wff is always true (even
     if the antecedent is false).  Thus, if "implies" means material
     implication, it is true that "if the moon is made of green cheese that
     implies that 5=5" (because 5=5).  Similarly, if the antecedent is false,
     the wff is always true.  Thus, it is true that, "if the moon made of green
     cheese that implies that 5=7" (because the moon is not actually made of
     green cheese).  A contradiction implies anything ( ~ pm2.21i ).  In short,
     material implication has a very specific technical definition, and
     misunderstandings of it are sometimes called "paradoxes of logical
     implication." $)

        The axioms of propositional calculus
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

  Propositional calculus (axioms ~ ax-1 through ~ ax-3 and rule ~ ax-mp ) can
  be thought of as asserting formulas that are universally "true" when their
  variables are replaced by any combination of "true" and "false."
  Propositional calculus was first formalized by Frege in 1879, using as his
  axioms (in addition to rule ~ ax-mp ) the wffs ~ ax-1 , ~ ax-2 , ~ pm2.04 ,
  ~ con3 , ~ notnot2 , and ~ notnot1 . Around 1930, Lukasiewicz simplified the
  system by eliminating the third (which follows from the first two, as you can
  see by looking at the proof of ~ pm2.04 ) and replacing the last three with
  our ~ ax-3 . (Thanks to Ted Ulrich for this information.)

  The theorems of propositional calculus are also called _tautologies_.
  Tautologies can be proved very simply using truth tables, based on the
  true/false interpretation of propositional calculus.  To do this, we assign
  all possible combinations of true and false to the wff variables and verify
  that the result (using the rules described in ~ wi and ~ wn ) always
  evaluates to true.  This is called the _semantic_ approach.  Our approach is
  called the _syntactic_ approach, in which everything is derived from axioms.
  A metatheorem called the Completeness Theorem for Propositional Calculus
  shows that the two approaches are equivalent and even provides an algorithm
  for automatically generating syntactic proofs from a truth table.  Those
  proofs, however, tend to be long, since truth tables grow exponentially with
  the number of variables, and the much shorter proofs that we show here were
  found manually.

       "modus ponendo ponens," a Latin phrase that means "the mode that by
       affirming affirms" - remark in [Sanford] p. 39.  This rule is similar to
       the rule of modus tollens ~ mto .

       Note:  In some web page displays such as the Statement List, the
       symbols " ` & ` " and " ` => ` " informally indicate the relationship
       between the hypotheses and the assertion (conclusion), abbreviating the
       English words "and" and "implies."  They are not part of the formal
       language.  (Contributed by NM, 30-Sep-1992.) $)

     statement "if there are no clouds in the sky, it is not raining" implies
     the statement "if it is raining, there are clouds in the sky."  This axiom
     is called _Transp_ or "the principle of transposition" in _Principia
     Mathematica_ (Theorem *2.17 of [WhiteheadRussell] p. 103).  We will also
     use the term "contraposition" for this principle, although the reader is
     advised that in the field of philosophical logic, "contraposition" has a
     different technical meaning.  (Contributed by NM, 30-Sep-1992.) $)

  $( Define the biconditional (logical 'iff').

     The definition ~ df-bi in this section is our first definition, which
     introduces and defines the biconditional connective ` <-> ` .  We define a
     wff of the form ` ( ph <-> ps ) ` as an abbreviation for
     ` -. ( ( ph -> ps ) -> -. ( ps -> ph ) ) ` .

     Unlike most traditional developments, we have chosen not to have a
     separate symbol such as "Df." to mean "is defined as."  Instead, we will
     later use the biconditional connective for this purpose ( ~ df-or is its
     first use), as it allows us to use logic to manipulate definitions
     directly.  This greatly simplifies many proofs since it eliminates the
     need for a separate mechanism for introducing and eliminating
     definitions.  Of course, we cannot use this mechanism to define the
     biconditional itself, since it hasn't been introduced yet.  Instead, we
     use a more general form of definition, described as follows.

     In its most general form, a definition is simply an assertion that
     introduces a new symbol (or a new combination of existing symbols, as in
     ~ df-3an ) that is eliminable and does not strengthen the existing
     language.  The latter requirement means that the set of provable
     statements not containing the new symbol (or new combination) should
     remain exactly the same after the definition is introduced.  Our
     definition of the biconditional may look unusual compared to most
     definitions, but it strictly satisfies these requirements.

     The justification for our definition is that if we mechanically replace
     ` ( ph <-> ps ) ` (the definiendum i.e. the thing being defined) with
     ` -. ( ( ph -> ps ) -> -. ( ps -> ph ) ) ` (the definiens i.e. the
     defining expression) in the definition, the definition becomes the
     previously proved theorem ~ bijust .  It is impossible to use ~ df-bi to
     prove any statement expressed in the original language that can't be
     proved from the original axioms, because if we simply replace each
     instance of ~ df-bi in the proof with the corresponding ~ bijust instance,
     we will end up with a proof from the original axioms.

     Note that from Metamath's point of view, a definition is just another
     axiom - i.e. an assertion we claim to be true - but from our high level
     point of view, we are not strengthening the language.  To indicate this
     fact, we prefix definition labels with "df-" instead of "ax-".  (This
     prefixing is an informal convention that means nothing to the Metamath
     proof verifier; it is just a naming convention for human readability.)

     After we define the constant true ` T. ` ( ~ df-tru ) and the constant
     false ` F. ` ( ~ df-fal ), we will be able to prove these truth table
     values: ` ( ( T. <-> T. ) <-> T. ) ` ( ~ trubitru ),
     ` ( ( T. <-> F. ) <-> F. ) ` ( ~ trubifal ), ` ( ( F. <-> T. ) <-> F. ) `
     ( ~ falbitru ), and ` ( ( F. <-> F. ) <-> T. ) ` ( ~ falbifal ).

     See ~ dfbi1 , ~ dfbi2 , and ~ dfbi3 for theorems suggesting typical
     textbook definitions of ` <-> ` , showing that our definition has the
     properties we expect.  Theorem ~ dfbi1 is particularly useful if we want
     to eliminate ` <-> ` from an expression to convert it to primitives.
     Theorem ~ dfbi shows this definition rewritten in an abbreviated form
     after conjunction is introduced, for easier understanding.

     Contrast with ` \/ ` ( ~ df-or ), ` -> ` ( ~ wi ), ` -/\ ` ( ~ df-nan ),
     and ` \/_ ` ( ~ df-xor ) .  In some sense ` <-> ` returns true if two
     truth values are equal; ` = ` ( ~ df-cleq ) returns true if two classes
     are equal.  (Contributed by NM, 27-Dec-1992.) $)

     proof of ~ dfbi1 expanded into axioms.  Second, step 2 demands only the
     property of "true"; any axiom (or theorem) could be used.  It might be
     thought, therefore, that it is in some sense redundant, but in fact no
     proof is shorter than this (measured by number of steps).  Third, it
     illustrates how intermediate steps can "blow up" in size even in short
     proofs.  Fourth, the compressed proof is only 182 bytes (or 17 bytes in
     D-proof notation), but the generated web page is over 200kB with
     intermediate steps that are essentially incomprehensible to humans (other
     than Gregory Bush).  If there were an obfuscated code contest for proofs,
     this would be a contender.  This "blowing up" and incomprehensibility of
     the intermediate steps vividly demonstrate the advantages of using many
     layered intermediate theorems, since each theorem is easier to
     understand.  (Contributed by Gregory Bush, 10-Mar-2004.)

  Here we define disjunction (logical 'or') ` \/ ` ( ~ df-or ) and conjunction
  (logical 'and') ` /\ ` ( ~ df-an ). We also define various rules for
  simplifying and applying them, e.g., ~ olc , ~ orc , and ~ orcom .

  $( Extend wff definition to include disjunction ('or'). $)
  wo $a wff ( ph \/ ps ) $.
  $( Extend wff definition to include conjunction ('and'). $)
  wa $a wff ( ph /\ ps ) $.

  $( Define disjunction (logical 'or').  Definition of [Margaris] p. 49.  When
     the left operand, right operand, or both are true, the result is true;
     when both sides are false, the result is false.  For example, it is true
     that ` ( 2 = 3 \/ 4 = 4 ) ` ( ~ ex-or ).  After we define the constant
     true ` T. ` ( ~ df-tru ) and the constant false ` F. ` ( ~ df-fal ), we
     will be able to prove these truth table values:
     ` ( ( T. \/ T. ) <-> T. ) ` ( ~ truortru ), ` ( ( T. \/ F. ) <-> T. ) `
     ( ~ truorfal ), ` ( ( F. \/ T. ) <-> T. ) ` ( ~ falortru ), and
     ` ( ( F. \/ F. ) <-> F. ) ` ( ~ falorfal ).

     This is our first use of the biconditional connective in a definition; we
     use the biconditional connective in place of the traditional "<=def=>",
     which means the same thing, except that we can manipulate the
     biconditional connective directly in proofs rather than having to rely on
     an informal definition substitution rule.  Note that if we mechanically
     substitute ` ( -. ph -> ps ) ` for ` ( ph \/ ps ) ` , we end up with an
     instance of previously proved theorem ~ biid .  This is the justification
     for the definition, along with the fact that it introduces a new symbol
     ` \/ ` .  Contrast with ` /\ ` ( ~ df-an ), ` -> ` ( ~ wi ), ` -/\ `
     ( ~ df-nan ), and ` \/_ ` ( ~ df-xor ) .  (Contributed by NM,

                   The conditional operator for propositions
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

  This section introduces the conditional operator for propositions, denoted by
  ` if- ` (see ~ df-ifp ).  It is the analogue for propositions of the
  conditional operator for classes ` if ` (see ~ df-if ).

$)

  $( Comma.  Also used later for adders, pairs, tuples, etc. $)
  $c , $.

  $( Symbol for the conditional operator for propositions. $)
  $c if- $.

  $( Extend class notation to include the conditional operator for
     propositions. $)
  wif $a wff if- ( ph , ps , ch ) $.

  $( Definition of the conditional operator for propositions.  The value of
     ` if- ( ph , ps , ch ) ` is ` ps ` if ` ph ` is true and ` ch ` if ` ph `
     false.  See ~ dfifp2 , ~ dfifp3 , ~ dfifp4 , ~ dfifp5 , ~ dfifp6 and
     ~ dfifp7 for alternate definitions.

     This definition (in the form of ~ dfifp2 ) appears in Section II.24 of
     [Church] p. 129 (Definition D12 page 132), where it is called "conditioned
     disjunction".  Church's ` [ ps , ph , ch ] ` corresponds to our
     ` if- ( ph , ps , ch ) ` (note the permutation of the first two
     variables).

     Church uses the conditional operator as an intermediate step to prove
     completeness of some systems of connectives.  The first result is that the
     system ` { if- , T. , F. } ` is complete: for the induction step, consider
     a wff with n+1 variables; single out one variable, say ` ph ` ; when one
     sets ` ph ` to True (resp.  False), then what remains is a wff of n
     variables, so by the induction hypothesis it corresponds to a formula
     using only ` { if- , T. , F. } ` , say ` ps ` (resp. ` ch ` ); therefore,
     the formula ` if- ( ph , ps , ch ) ` represents the initial wff.  Now,
     since ` { -> , -. } ` and similar systems suffice to express
     ` if- , T. , F. ` , they are also complete.

    $( This syntax construction states that a variable ` x ` , which has been

       expression.  This can be justified informally as follows.  We know that
       the class builder ` { y | y e. x } ` is a class by ~ cab .  Since (when
       ` y ` is distinct from ` x ` ) we have ` x = { y | y e. x } ` by
       ~ cvjust , we can argue that the syntax " ` class x ` " can be viewed as
       an abbreviation for " ` class { y | y e. x } ` ".  See the discussion
       under the definition of class in [Jech] p. 4 showing that "Every set can
       be considered to be a class."

       While it is tempting and perhaps occasionally useful to view ~ cv as a
       "type conversion" from a setvar variable to a class variable, keep in
       mind that ~ cv is intrinsically no different from any other
       class-building syntax such as ~ cab , ~ cun , or ~ c0 .

       For a general discussion of the theory of classes and the role of ~ cv ,
       see ~ http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/mmset.html#class .

       (The description above applies to set theory, not predicate calculus.
       The purpose of introducing ` class x ` here, and not in set theory where
       it belongs, is to allow us to express i.e.  "prove" the ~ weq of
       predicate calculus from the ~ wceq of set theory, so that we don't
       overload the ` = ` connective with two syntax definitions.  This is done
       to prevent ambiguity that would complicate some Metamath parsers.) $)

       Half adder and full adder in propositional calculus
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

  Propositional calculus deals with truth values, which can be interpreted as
  bits.  Using this, we can define the half adder and the full adder in pure
  propositional calculus, and show their basic properties.

  The half adder adds two 1-bit numbers.  Its two outputs are the "sum" S and
  the "carry" C.  The real sum is then given by 2C+S.  The sum and carry
  correspond respectively to the logical exclusive disjunction (~ df-xor ) and
  the logical conjunction (~ df-an ).

  The full adder takes into account an "input carry", so it has three inputs
  and again two outputs, corresponding to the "sum" (~ df-had ) and "updated
  carry" (~ df-cad ).
  Here is a short description.  We code the bit 0 by ` F. ` and 1 by ` T. ` .
  Even though ` hadd ` and ` cadd ` are invariant under permutation of their
  arguments, assume for the sake of concreteness that ` ph ` (resp. ` ps ` ) is
  the i^th bit of the first (resp. second) number to add (with the convention
  that the i^th bit is the multiple of 2^i in the base-2 representation), and
  that ` ch ` is the i^th carry (with the convention that the 0^th carry is 0).
  Then, ` hadd ( ph , ps , ch ) ` gives the i^th bit of the sum, and
  ` cadd ( ph , ps , ch ) ` gives the (i+1)^th carry.
  Then, addition is performed by iteration from i = 0 to
  i = 1 + (max of the number of digits of the two summands) by "updating" the
  carry.

     implication are primitive.  Here we prove Meredith's axiom from ~ ax-1 ,
     ~ ax-2 , and ~ ax-3 .  Then from it we derive the Lukasiewicz axioms
     ~ luk-1 , ~ luk-2 , and ~ luk-3 .  Using these we finally re-derive our
     axioms as ~ ax1 , ~ ax2 , and ~ ax3 , thus proving the equivalence of all
     three systems.  C. A. Meredith, "Single Axioms for the Systems (C,N),
     (C,O) and (A,N) of the Two-Valued Propositional Calculus," _The Journal of
     Computing Systems_ vol. 1 (1953), pp. 155-164.  Meredith claimed to be
     close to a proof that this axiom is the shortest possible, but the proof
     was apparently never completed.

     An obscure Irish lecturer, Meredith (1904-1976) became enamored with logic
     somewhat late in life after attending talks by Lukasiewicz and produced
     many remarkable results such as this axiom.  From his obituary:  "He did
     logic whenever time and opportunity presented themselves, and he did it on
     whatever materials came to hand: in a pub, his favored pint of porter
     within reach, he would use the inside of cigarette packs to write proofs
     for logical colleagues."  (Contributed by NM, 14-Dec-2002.)  (Proof

     Lammen, 28-May-2013.) $)

  The Stoic Chrysippus, in particular, was often considered one of the greatest
  logicians of antiquity.
  Stoic logic is different from Aristotle's system, since it focuses
  on propositional logic,
  though later thinkers did combine the systems of the Stoics with Aristotle.
  Jan Lukasiewicz reports,
  "For anybody familiar with mathematical logic it is self-evident
  that the Stoic dialectic is the ancient form of modern propositional logic"
  ( _On the history of the logic of proposition_ by Jan Lukasiewicz (1934),
  translated in: _Selected Works_ - Edited by Ludwik Borkowski -
  Amsterdam, North-Holland, 1970 pp. 197-217,
  referenced in "History of Logic"
  ~ https://www.historyoflogic.com/logic-stoics.htm ).

  In this section we show that the propositional logic system we use
  (which is non-modal) is at least as strong as the non-modal portion
  of Stoic logic.  We show this by showing that our system
  assumes or proves all of key features of Stoic logic's non-modal portion
  (specifically the Stoic logic indemonstrables, themata, and principles).

  "In terms of contemporary logic, Stoic syllogistic is best understood as
  a substructural backwards-working Gentzen-style natural-deduction system
  that consists of five kinds of axiomatic arguments (the indemonstrables)
  and four inference rules, called themata.  An argument is a syllogism
  precisely if it either is an indemonstrable or can be reduced to one by
  means of the themata (Diogenes Laertius (D. L. 7.78))."
  (_Ancient Logic_, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy
  ~ https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-ancient/ ).
  There are also a few "principles" that support logical reasoning,
  discussed below.  For more information, see
  "Stoic Logic" by Susanne Bobzien, especially
  [Bobzien] p. 110-120, especially for a discussion about the themata
  (including how they were reconstructed and how they were used).
  There are differences in the systems we can only partly represent,
  for example, in Stoic logic
  "truth and falsehood are temporal properties of assertibles...
  They can belong to an assertible at
  one time but not at another" ([Bobzien] p. 87).
  Stoic logic also included various kinds of modalities, which we do not
  include here since our basic propositional logic does not include modalities.

  A key part of the Stoic logic system is a set of five "indemonstrables"
  assigned to Chrysippus of Soli by Diogenes Laertius, though in
  general it is difficult to assign specific ideas to specific thinkers.
  The indemonstrables are described in, for example,
  [Lopez-Astorga] p. 11 , [Sanford] p. 39, and [Hitchcock] p. 5.
  These indemonstrables are
  modus ponendo ponens (modus ponens) ~ ax-mp ,
  modus tollendo tollens (modus tollens) ~ mto ,
  modus ponendo tollens I ~ mptnan ,
  modus ponendo tollens II ~ mptxor , and
  modus tollendo ponens (exclusive-or version) ~ mtpxor .
  The first is an axiom, the second is already proved; in this section
  we prove the other three.
  Note that modus tollendo ponens ~ mtpxor originally used exclusive-or,
  but over time the name modus tollendo ponens has increasingly referred
  to an inclusive-or variation, which is proved in ~ mtpor .

  After we prove the indemonstratables, we then prove all the Stoic logic
  themata (the inference rules of Stoic logic; "thema" is singular).
  This is straightforward for thema 1 ( ~ stoic1a and ~ stoic1b )
  and thema 3 ( ~ stoic3 ).
  However, while Stoic logic was once a leading logic system,
  most direct information about Stoic logic
  has since been lost, including the exact texts of thema 2 and thema 4.
  There are, however, enough references and specific
  examples to support reconstruction.  Themata 2 and 4
  have been reconstructed; see statements T2 and T4 in
  [Bobzien] p. 110-120 and our proofs of them in ~ stoic2a , ~ stoic2b ,
  ~ stoic4a , and ~ stoic4b .

  Stoic logic also had a set of principles involving assertibles.
  Statements in [Bobzien] p. 99 express the known principles.
  The following paragraphs discuss these principles and our proofs of them.

  "A principle of double negation, expressed by saying that a
  double-negation (Not: not: p) is equivalent to the assertible
  that is doubly negated (p) (DL VII 69)."  In other words,
  ` ( ph <-> -. -. ph ) ` as proven in ~ notnot .

  "The principle that all conditionals that are formed by using
  the same assertible twice (like 'If p, p') are true (Cic. Acad. II 98)."
  In other words, ` ( ph -> ph ) ` as proven in ~ id .

  "The principle that all disjunctions formed by a contradiction
   (like 'Either p or not: p') are true (S. E. M VIII 282)"
  Remember that in Stoic logic, 'or' means 'exclusive or'.
  In other words, ` ( ph \/_ -. ph ) ` as proven in ~ xorexmid .

  [Bobzien] p. 99 also suggests that Stoic logic may have dealt with
  commutativity (see ~ xorcom and ~ ancom ) and the
  principle of contraposition ( ~ ax-3 ) (pointing to DL VII 194).

  In short, the non-modal propositional logic system we use is at
  least as strong as the non-modal portion of Stoic logic.

    Predicate calculus with equality:  Tarski's system S2 (1 rule, 6 schemes)
#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#

  Here we extend the language of wffs with predicate calculus, which allows us
  to talk about individual objects in a domain of discussion (which for us will
  be the universe of all sets, so we call them "setvar variables") and make
  true/false statements about predicates, which are relationships between
  objects, such as whether or not two objects are equal.  In addition, we
  introduce universal quantification ("for all", e.g. ~ ax-4 ) in order to
  make statements about whether a wff holds for every object in the domain of
  discussion.  Later we introduce existential quantification ("there exists",
  ~ df-ex ) which is defined in terms of universal quantification.

  Our axioms are really axiom _schemes_, and our wff and setvar variables are
  metavariables ranging over expressions in an underlying "object language."
  This is explained here:  ~ mmset.html#axiomnote .

  Our axiom system starts with the predicate calculus axiom schemes system S2
  of Tarski defined in his 1965 paper, "A Simplified Formalization of Predicate
  Logic with Identity" [Tarski].  System S2 is defined in the last paragraph on
  p. 77, and repeated on p. 81 of [KalishMontague].  We do not include scheme
  B5 (our ~ sp ) of system S2 since [KalishMontague] shows it to be logically
  redundant (Lemma 9, p. 87, which we prove as theorem ~ spw below).

  Theorem ~ spw can be used to prove any _instance_ of ~ sp having mutually
  distinct setvar variables and no wff metavariables.  However, it seems that
  ~ sp in its general form cannot be derived from only Tarski's schemes.  We do
  not include B5 i.e. ~ sp as part of what we call "Tarski's system" because we
  want it to be the smallest set of axioms that is logically complete with
  no redundancies.  We later prove ~ sp as theorem ~ axc5 using the auxiliary
  axioms that make our system metalogically complete.

  Our version of Tarski's system S2 consists of propositional calculus
  ( ~ ax-mp , ~ ax-1 , ~ ax-2 , ~ ax-3 ) plus ~ ax-gen , ~ ax-4 , ~ ax-5 ,
  ~ ax-6 , ~ ax-7 , ~ ax-8 , and ~ ax-9 . The last three are equality axioms
  that represent three sub-schemes of Tarski's scheme B8.  Due to its
  side-condition ("where ` ph ` is an atomic formula and ` ps ` is obtained by
  replacing an occurrence of the variable ` x ` by the variable ` y ` "), we
  cannot represent his B8 directly without greatly complicating our scheme
  language, but the simpler schemes ~ ax-7 , ~ ax-8 , and ~ ax-9 are sufficient
  for set theory and much easier to work with.

  Tarski's system is exactly equivalent to the traditional axiom system in most
  logic textbooks but has the advantage of being easy to manipulate with a
  computer program, and its simpler metalogic (with no built-in notions of
  "free variable" and "proper substitution") is arguably easier for a
  non-logician human to follow step by step in a proof (where "follow" means
  being able to identify the substitutions that were made, without necessarily
  a higher-level understanding).  In particular, it is logically complete in
  that it can derive all possible object-language theorems of predicate
  calculus with equality, i.e. the same theorems as the traditional system can
  derive.

  However, for efficiency (and indeed a key feature that makes Metamath
  successful), our system is designed to derive reusable theorem schemes
  (rather than object-language theorems) from other schemes.  From this
  "metalogical" point of view, Tarski's S2 is not complete.  For example, we
  cannot derive scheme ~ sp , even though (using ~ spw ) we can derive all
  instances of it that don't involve wff metavariables or bundled set
  metavariables.  (Two set metavariables are "bundled" if they can be
  substituted with the same set metavariable i.e. do not have a $d distinct
  variable proviso.)  Later we will introduce auxiliary axiom schemes ~ ax-10 ,
  ~ ax-11 , ~ ax-12 , and ~ ax-13 that are metatheorems of Tarski's system
  (i.e. are logically redundant) but which give our system the property of
  "metalogical completeness," allowing us to prove directly (instead of, say,
  by induction on formula length) all possible schemes that can be expressed in
  our language.

  $( Define the not-free predicate for wffs.  This is read " ` x ` is not free

     value of ` ph ` , e.g., any occurrence of ` x ` in ` ph ` is effectively
     bound by a "for all" or something that expands to one (such as "there
     exists").  In particular, substitution for a variable not free in a wff
     does not affect its value ( ~ sbf ).  An example of where this is used is
     ~ stdpc5 .  See ~ nf2 for an alternative definition which does not involve
     nested quantifiers on the same variable.

     Not-free is a commonly used constraint, so it is useful to have a notation
     for it.  Surprisingly, there is no common formal notation for it, so here
     we devise one.  Our definition lets us work with the not-free notion
     within the logic itself rather than as a metalogical side condition.

     To be precise, our definition really means "effectively not free," because
     it is slightly less restrictive than the usual textbook definition for
     not-free (which only considers syntactic freedom).  For example, ` x ` is
     effectively not free in the bare expression ` x = x ` (see ~ nfequid ),
     even though ` x ` would be considered free in the usual textbook
     definition, because the value of ` x ` in the expression ` x = x ` cannot
     affect the truth of the expression (and thus substitution will not change
     the result).

       See ~ exlimi for a more general version requiring more axioms.

       This inference, along with its many variants such as ~ rexlimdv , is
       used to implement a metatheorem called "Rule C" that is given in many
       logic textbooks.  See, for example, Rule C in [Mendelson] p. 81, Rule C
       in [Margaris] p. 40, or Rule C in Hirst and Hirst's _A Primer for Logic
       and Proof_ p. 59 (PDF p. 65) at
       ~ http://www.appstate.edu/~~hirstjl/primer/hirst.pdf .  In informal
       proofs, the statement "Let ` C ` be an element such that..." almost
       always means an implicit application of Rule C.

       In essence, Rule C states that if we can prove that some element ` x `
       exists satisfying a wff, i.e. ` E. x ph ( x ) ` where ` ph ( x ) ` has
       ` x ` free, then we can use ` ph ( C ) ` as a hypothesis for the proof
       where ` C ` is a new (fictitious) constant not appearing previously in
       the proof, nor in any axioms used, nor in the theorem to be proved.  The
       purpose of Rule C is to get rid of the existential quantifier.

       We cannot do this in Metamath directly.  Instead, we use the original
       ` ph ` (containing ` x ` ) as an antecedent for the main part of the
       proof.  We eventually arrive at ` ( ph -> ps ) ` where ` ps ` is the
       theorem to be proved and does not contain ` x ` .  Then we apply
       ~ exlimiv to arrive at ` ( E. x ph -> ps ) ` .  Finally, we separately
       prove ` E. x ph ` and detach it with modus ponens ~ ax-mp to arrive at
       the final theorem ` ps ` .  (Contributed by NM, 21-Jun-1993.)  Remove

       condition.  For instance, ~ 19.21v versus ~ 19.21 and ~ vtoclf versus
       ~ vtocl .  Note that "not free in" is less restrictive than "does not
       occur in."  Note that the version with a dv condition is easily proved
       from the version with the corresponding non-freeness hypothesis, by
       using ~ nfv .  However, the dv version can often be proved from fewer
       axioms.  (Contributed by NM, 21-Jun-1993.)  Reduce dependencies on
       axioms.  (Revised by Wolf Lammen, 2-Jan-2020.)  (Proof shortened by Wolf
