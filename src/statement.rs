//! The `Statement` data structure and related API.
//!
//! ## Addresses, indices, and references
//!
//! To identify a statement uniquely, you need to know the segment ID, and the
//! offset of the statement within the segment.  This is two numbers; global
//! statement numbers can be computed, but are not widely used because they
//! change too frequently in an incremental setting.  Those two numbers together
//! can be handled as a `StatementAddress` structure.
//!
//! Within the parser itself, the segment ID is not known yet; they are assigned
//! after all file inclusions have been resolved, which can only be done after
//! the parsing phase is complete.  Fortunately, the parsing process always
//! works with one segment at a time, so it is sufficient to use the local
//! offset alone; the type `StatementIndex` is provided to make intent clear.
//! `StatementIndex` can also be used in other analysis passes if, for wahtever
//! reason, the segment ID is known from context.
//!
//! If you want to fetch actual data for a statement, you will need pointers
//! into the segment data structures which store statement data.  A
//! `StatementRef` structure encapsulates a statement address and all necessary
//! pointers to fetch data; it can be used to fetch any parse-time information,
//! but it is larger than a `StatementAddress`, and because it contains borrowed
//! pointers it cannot be stored in long-lived data structures in any event.
//!
//! `TokenAddress`, `TokenIndex`, and `TokenRef` are provided for the same use
//! cases as applied to tokens in math strings.  A `TokenAddress` contains three
//! numbers; you will often want to use the `Atom`s provided by scopeck instead,
//! as they are smaller and can be compared directly.
//!
//! `SegmentId` and `SegmentRef` cover the same use cases for segments, although
//! it makes no sense to have a segment-local segment reference.
